# MESSAGE ENCODE-DECODE PYTHON PROJECT

The objective of this project is to encode and decode messages using a common key. The project is built using the **Tkinter** and **base64** library.
In this project, the user have to enter the message to encode or decode. User have to select the mode to choose the encoding and decoding process. The same key must be used to process the encoding and decoding for the same message.

### PROJECT PREREQUISITES

In this project I have used the basic concept of python, Tkinter, and base64 library.

* **Tkinter** is a standard GUI(Graphical User Interface) python library.
* **base64** module provides a function to encode the binary data to ASCII characters and decode that ASCII characters back to binary data.

### INSTALLING THE REQUIRED LIBRARIES
   I have installed these libraries using Ubuntu 18.04 terminal.

* #### Installing Tkinter
    ```
       sudo apt-get update
       sudo apt-get install python3-tk
    ```
* #### Installing base64
    ```
        sudo apt-get install cl-base64
    ```
### PROJECT FILE STRUCTURE

   These are the step to build message encode â€“ decode python project
   * Importing module
   * Creating display window
   * Defining function
   * Defining labels and buttons
